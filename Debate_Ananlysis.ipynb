              "'Let me begin by thanking the\\nAssembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by\\nnoting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the\\nGeneral Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.\\nPeace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.\\nBosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United\\nNations is actively mediating crises before they explode\\ninto war, all around the world. And today more people\\ndetermine their own destiny than at any previous moment\\nin history.\\nWe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights with those rights more\\nwidely embraced than ever before. On every continent\\npeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and\\na great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United\\nNations.\\nStill, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise\\nof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil\\ntoday threatens to undermine confidence in free markets\\nand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from\\nthis economy have a special responsibility to do more to\\nminimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global\\nmarkets to all citizens. And the United States is\\ndetermined to do that.\\nWe still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious\\nand tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many\\nStates to acquire such weapons.\\nAnd, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not\\nfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a\\ncontinuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which says\\n9\\n\\n\\n“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of\\nperson.”\\nHere at the United Nations, at international summits\\naround the world and on many occasions in the United\\nStates, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in\\ndetail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing\\nand what we must yet do to combat terror.\\nToday I would like to talk to the Assembly about why\\nall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of\\nour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern\\nto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted\\nover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi\\nArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own\\ncitizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public\\nbuildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and\\nDar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives\\nto building bridges between nations — people very much\\nlike all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred\\nagainst the United States.\\nBecause we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with\\na powerful military and a worldwide presence active in\\npromoting peace and security, we are often a target. We\\nlove our country for its dedication to political and religious\\nfreedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights\\nof the individual. But we know that many people see us as\\na symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they\\nfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots\\nelsewhere.\\nBut we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we\\nbelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continue\\nour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us\\nto pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our\\nbacks on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own\\nopposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace\\na victory they must never have.\\nStill, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as\\nonly, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a\\nclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and\\ninnocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the\\npeople represented here, is immune. Certainly not the\\npeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American\\nkilled there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500\\nmore injured — innocent people going about their business\\non a busy morning.\\nNot the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where\\nthe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants\\nalike — mostly children and women, two of them\\npregnant — people out shopping together when their\\nfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the\\npast.\\nNot the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin\\ngas in the Tokyo subway.\\nNot the people of Argentina, who died when a car\\nbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos\\nAires.\\nNot the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by\\nancient animosities that cry out for resolution.\\nNot the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year\\nafter year, for all their progress towards peace.\\nNot the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of\\nunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.\\nNot the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second\\nPresident to assassination.\\nNot the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,\\nRussia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where\\ninnocent people have been victimized by terror.\\nNone of those victims were American. But every\\none was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or\\nmother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s\\nhatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never\\nbe the same.\\nTerror has become the world’s problem. Some argue,\\nof course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the\\nnumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,\\nsometimes less than the number of people killed by\\nlightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point\\nin several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the\\n1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater\\nopenness and the explosion of information and weapons\\ntechnology. The new technologies of terror and their\\nincreasing availability, along with the increasing mobility\\nof terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to\\nchemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing\\neach of us into the category of possible victim. This is a\\nthreat to all humankind.\\nBeyond the physical damage of each attack, there is\\nan even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to\\nmeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb\\n10\\n\\n\\nthreat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;\\nthe kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so\\nhard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or\\nchild is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the\\nrest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so\\ncrucial to peace and prosperity.\\nIn every corner of the world, with the active support\\nof United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build\\nbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with\\ntheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors from\\naround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in\\nNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday\\nAgreement. But that took confidence, confidence that\\ncannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure\\neach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But\\nwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle\\nEast, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements\\nhave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many\\nbusinesses will never be created in places crying out for\\ninvestments of time and money? How many talented young\\npeople in countries represented here have turned their backs\\non public service? The question is not only how many lives\\nhave been lost in each attack, but how many futures were\\nlost in their aftermath.\\nThere is no justification for killing innocents.\\nIdeology, religion and politics, even deprivation and\\nrighteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to\\nunderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of\\ncourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seen\\nthat where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate\\nact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing\\ncame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the\\nMiddle East, whenever we get close to another step towards\\npeace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this\\nstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,\\nafter all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and\\nthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their\\nown hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases\\nterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.\\nWe must also acknowledge that there are economic\\nsources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses\\nof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the\\nsiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing\\nsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor\\ncan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents\\nis not a social programme.\\nNevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does\\nnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that\\nfoster it. The most recent United Nations Human\\nDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is widening\\nbetween the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work\\nharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into\\nthe poison of hatred.\\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only\\nrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must\\nshow people they have everything to gain by embracing\\ncooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply\\nan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s\\nresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to\\nspread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to\\nbuild new, open economies. Developed nations have an\\nobligation to help developing nations stay on the path of\\nprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week\\nago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international\\neconomy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens\\nwithin them.\\nSome believe that terrorism’s principal fault line\\ncentres on what they see as an inevitable clash of\\ncivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate\\nin this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an\\ninevitable clash between Western civilization and values\\nand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is\\nterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any\\nreligion to justify whatever political objectives they\\nhave — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the\\nworld believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,\\ngrants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding\\nof Islam.\\nA quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from\\nAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the United\\nStates, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.\\nThere are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the\\nUnited States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The\\n6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there\\nis no inherent clash between Islam and America.\\nAmericans respect and honour Islam.\\nAs I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and\\naround the world, I see again that we share the same\\nhopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to\\nprovide for our children, to follow the faith of our\\nchoosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and\\nto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.\\nOf course, we are not identical. There are important\\ndifferences that cross race and culture and religion which\\ndemand understanding and deserve respect. But every\\n11\\n\\n\\nriver has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in\\nAmerica, like the United Nations, to reconcile all\\nAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in our\\nincreasing diversity, we will remain on a course of\\nfriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will\\ncontinue to look for common values, common interests and\\ncommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit\\nexpressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for\\nprayers by people assembled together are twice those for\\nprayers said at home.”\\nWhen it comes to terrorism, there should be no\\ndividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and\\nCatholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and\\nemerging countries. The only dividing line is between those\\nwho practise, support or tolerate terror and those who\\nunderstand that it is murder, plain and simple.\\nIf terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and\\nshould be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are\\nthe concrete steps we can take together to protect our\\ncommon destiny? What are our common obligations? At\\nleast, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,\\nno sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on\\nStates that do; to act together to step up extradition and\\nprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to\\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce\\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger\\ndomestic laws and control the manufacture and export of\\nexplosives; to raise international standards for airport\\nsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence and\\ndespair.\\nWe are working to do our part. Our intelligence and\\nlaw enforcement communities are tracking terrorist\\nnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of\\nthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our\\nembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I\\nwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to\\nrepair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the\\nworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in\\nKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.\\nBut no matter how much each of us does alone, our\\nprogress will be limited without our common efforts.\\nWe will also do our part to address the sources of\\ndespair and alienation through the Agency for International\\nDevelopment in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in\\nEastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue\\nour strong support for the United Nations Development\\nProgramme, the Office of the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United\\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\\nNations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World\\nFood Programme. We also recognize the critical role\\nthese agencies play and the importance of all countries,\\nincluding the United States, in paying their fair share.\\nIn closing, let me urge all of us to think in new\\nterms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or\\npolitical action by other means, or a divine calling, but as\\na clash between the forces of the past and the forces of\\nthe future, between those who tear down and those who\\nbuild up, between hope and fear, between chaos and\\ncommunity.\\nThe fight will not be easy. But every nation will be\\nstrengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning\\nto the words of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important\\nthat we do this together.\\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the\\nUniversal Declaration. She said, in one of her many\\nspeeches in support of the United Nations when it was\\njust beginning,\\n“All agreements and all peace are built on\\nconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot\\nget on with other people in the world unless you\\nhave confidence in them.”\\nIt is not necessary that we solve all the world’s\\nproblems to have confidence in one another. It is not\\nnecessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have\\nconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary that\\nwe understand every single difference among us to have\\nconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that we\\naffirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together\\nwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a\\nthrowback to yesterday, and together, together we can\\nmeet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears\\nwith confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

              "'Let me begin by thanking the Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by noting that, at the opening of this fifty third session of the General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate. Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years. Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United Nations is actively mediating crises before they explode into war, all around the world. And today more people determine their own destiny than at any previous moment in history. We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with those rights more widely embraced than ever before. On every continent people are leading lives of integrity and self respect, and a great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United Nations. Still, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise of our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil today threatens to undermine confidence in free markets and democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from this economy have a special responsibility to do more to minimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global markets to all citizens. And the United States is determined to do that. We still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious and tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass destruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many States to acquire such weapons. And, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not fading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a continuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says 9   “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.” Here at the United Nations, at international summits around the world and on many occasions in the United States, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in detail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing and what we must yet do to combat terror. Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about why all nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of our agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern to us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted over and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi Arabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own citizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public buildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives to building bridges between nations — people very much like all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred against the United States. Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with a powerful military and a worldwide presence active in promoting peace and security, we are often a target. We love our country for its dedication to political and religious freedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights of the individual. But we know that many people see us as a symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they find it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots elsewhere. But we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we believe the best way to disprove these claims is to continue our work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us to pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own opposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace a victory they must never have. Still, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as only, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and innocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the people represented here, is immune. Certainly not the people of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. For every American killed there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500 more injured — innocent people going about their business on a busy morning. Not the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where the wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants alike — mostly children and women, two of them pregnant — people out shopping together when their future was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the past. Not the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin gas in the Tokyo subway. Not the people of Argentina, who died when a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by ancient animosities that cry out for resolution. Not the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year after year, for all their progress towards peace. Not the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of unfathomable terror with still no end in sight. Not the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second President to assassination. Not the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania, Russia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where innocent people have been victimized by terror. None of those victims were American. But every one was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or mother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s hatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never be the same. Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue, of course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the number of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small, sometimes less than the number of people killed by lightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point in several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the 1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater openness and the explosion of information and weapons technology. The new technologies of terror and their increasing availability, along with the increasing mobility of terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to chemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing each of us into the category of possible victim. This is a threat to all humankind. Beyond the physical damage of each attack, there is an even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to measure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb 10   threat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions; the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so hard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the rest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so crucial to peace and prosperity. In every corner of the world, with the active support of United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build better futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with their fellow citizens and with partners and investors from around the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in Northern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday Agreement. But that took confidence, confidence that cannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure each attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But what are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle East, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements have been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many businesses will never be created in places crying out for investments of time and money? How many talented young people in countries represented here have turned their backs on public service? The question is not only how many lives have been lost in each attack, but how many futures were lost in their aftermath. There is no justification for killing innocents. Ideology, religion and politics, even deprivation and righteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to understand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of course we must. Often in my own experience I have seen that where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate act to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing came as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the Middle East, whenever we get close to another step towards peace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this stall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is, after all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and thus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their own hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases terrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past. We must also acknowledge that there are economic sources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses of disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the siren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing social justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor can inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents is not a social programme. Nevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does not mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that foster it. The most recent United Nations Human Development Report suggests the gulf is widening between the world’s haves and have nots. We must work harder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into the poison of hatred. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only revolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must show people they have everything to gain by embracing cooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply an American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s responsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to spread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to build new, open economies. Developed nations have an obligation to help developing nations stay on the path of prosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week ago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international economy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens within them. Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault line centres on what they see as an inevitable clash of civilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate in this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an inevitable clash between Western civilization and values and Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is terribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any religion to justify whatever political objectives they have — even cold blooded murder. Some may have the world believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful, grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding of Islam. A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from Africa to the Middle East to Asia and to the United States, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths. There are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the United States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The 6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there is no inherent clash between Islam and America. Americans respect and honour Islam. As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and around the world, I see again that we share the same hopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to provide for our children, to follow the faith of our choosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and to pass on brighter possibilities to our children. Of course, we are not identical. There are important differences that cross race and culture and religion which demand understanding and deserve respect. But every 11   river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in America, like the United Nations, to reconcile all Americans to each other and to find greater unity in our increasing diversity, we will remain on a course of friendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will continue to look for common values, common interests and common endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit expressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for prayers by people assembled together are twice those for prayers said at home.” When it comes to terrorism, there should be no dividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and emerging countries. The only dividing line is between those who practise, support or tolerate terror and those who understand that it is murder, plain and simple. If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and should be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are the concrete steps we can take together to protect our common destiny? What are our common obligations? At least, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support, no sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on States that do; to act together to step up extradition and prosecution; to sign the global anti terror conventions; to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger domestic laws and control the manufacture and export of explosives; to raise international standards for airport security; to combat the conditions that spread violence and despair. We are working to do our part. Our intelligence and law enforcement communities are tracking terrorist networks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of those we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our embassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I will ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the worldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in Kenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered. But no matter how much each of us does alone, our progress will be limited without our common efforts. We will also do our part to address the sources of despair and alienation through the Agency for International Development in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue our strong support for the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World Food Programme. We also recognize the critical role these agencies play and the importance of all countries, including the United States, in paying their fair share. In closing, let me urge all of us to think in new terms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or political action by other means, or a divine calling, but as a clash between the forces of the past and the forces of the future, between those who tear down and those who build up, between hope and fear, between chaos and community. The fight will not be easy. But every nation will be strengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important that we do this together. Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the Universal Declaration. She said, in one of her many speeches in support of the United Nations when it was just beginning, “All agreements and all peace are built on confidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot get on with other people in the world unless you have confidence in them.” It is not necessary that we solve all the world’s problems to have confidence in one another. It is not necessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have confidence in one another. It is not even necessary that we understand every single difference among us to have confidence in one another. But it is necessary that we affirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together we say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a throwback to yesterday, and together, together we can meet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears with confidence.          '"
